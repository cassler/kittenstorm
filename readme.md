### PuppyStorm Announced! ##
With the amazing success to KittenStorm, we thought it unfair to descriminate against puppies. The best analogy here is Mac vs PC - we like options, but we all have our preferences. If you're wondering why there isn't a Linux reference in here - it's because we're not ready to announce (or even work on) PenguinStorm
